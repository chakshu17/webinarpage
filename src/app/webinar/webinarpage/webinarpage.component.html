          A <i>Supply chain</i> is a system of organizations, people, activities,
          information, and resources involved in supplying a product or service to
          a consumer. Supply chain activities involve the transformation of
          natural resources, raw materials, and components into a finished product
          that is delivered to the end customer. In sophisticated supply chain
          systems, used products may re-enter the supply chain at any point where
          residual value is recyclable.<br />
          A typical supply chain begins with the ecological, biological, and
          political regulation of natural resources, followed by the human
          extraction of raw material, and includes several production links (e.g.,
          component construction, assembly, and merging) before moving on to
          several layers of storage facilities of ever-decreasing size and
          increasingly remote geographical locations, and finally reaching the
          consumer. <br />
